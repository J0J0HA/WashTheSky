This mod, WashTheSky, is a skyblock starter mod. It gives you the possibillities to get almost all vanilla resources (in future; currently not all resources). 
First you use Wooden Buckets with Saplings to get Water and dirt, which you can use to get stone, cobblestone, gravel, sand, rubble and compost. 
Rubble and compost are special blocks: 
* Rubble drops, coal, iron, gold, diamonds, emeralds and some pices to craft stone, cobble, gravel, dirt and rubble again. 
* Compost drops many different seeds, sand dust and dirt crumbles. 
 
Smelting/Blasting/Smoking a Wooden Bucket of Water results in a Wooden Bucket of Steam which can be used to convert Sand Dust to Dirt Crumbles. 
The SVBCMT Converter (I'll rename it in later versions) can be used to automate all washing recipes (Its a wired interface, but it works. Just use shift if you don't know where to put something.) 
 
I think thats everything I made until now. I'm still working on the mod, as it is still in beta. 
 
 
You are allowed to use it in your modpacks.
